<h2>
    Colors In Web Design</h2>

<p>
    As a UI/UX developer there are allots of challenges that should be handled before we get the actual view of the project that we want. Although most of the problems can be handled by using a good design framework like Bootstrap or Foundation. Some of the
    design issues and design need to be handled/taken by designers/developers. One of the most prominent of these challenges is choosing the right color for the web page, and it is not limited to just web pages, we often get same problem while designing
    a logo too. It is not easy to find a set colors that defines the theme of the page ( brand's mantra in case of a logo ).

</p>
<h3>Colors are so important?
</h3>
<p>
    When I started designing web pages, I never thought about colors, I used to what ever was looked good to me, until I stumbled up on a really CRM project, they wanted different color theme for different modules of the project. It made me to think about
    colors and there connection with or mind, after burning a lot of my midnight oil. I got the answers.
</p>
<p>
    So, according to some psychologists color is second most important part of nonverbal communication, off-course first being signs. But color has less to do with our conscious mind and more to our unconscious mind. According to some business gurus, the
    decision of buying or using a product is taken in first 10 seconds when the customer sees the product and 70 percent of the decision depends on color.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Why colors have such a big space in our unconscious mind ?</i> From the childhood we see colors everywhere, and it is normal that we associate some colors with things, feelings, or a special person. Although choice of colors depends on individual
    preferences but there is a border view to it like when we talk about color green, 95 percent of us will picture plants, garden, forest and blood and fire come in mind when we talk about red.
</p>
<h3>Lets Choose Colors
</h3>
<p>It is one of the toughest job as a designer to select the main color, the color that should set the over all mood of the product (company, or web page). While choosing the color we should ask only one question.
</p>
<p>
    <i>What emotions do you associate your brand with.</i> Once you have a proper answer you should find a color associated to it. I have tried to add some examples below.
</p>
<p>
    <i style="color:red">Red:</i> It is the symbol passion, Aggression. That is why it is associated with love and power. The darker shades emphasize more on power and durability (such as red brick wall ).
</p>
<p>

    <i style="color:orange">Orange: </i>It is playful, energetic, and cheap.
</p>
<p>
    <i style="color:yellow">Yellow:</i> It is a symbol of happiness, friendship, warmth. Lighter shades of emphasize on happiness reminding the user about summer and sun. While darker shades including gold gives a sense of antiquity.</p>
<p>
    <i style="color:green">Green:</i> It is the most balanced color of the color wheel providing a proper gap between worm colors like yellow, orange and red , and cold colors like blue and purple. The message that green gives relates to nature, growth,
    stability and growth. It also re presents organic materials.
</p>
<p>
    <i style="color:blue">Blue:</i> It gives the sense of trust, security, serenity and invitation. Blue is also most popular color in the world. And it is arguable that because of its nature of trust and security, social media giants facebook, tweeter
    and linkedIn use it there logos. Even IBM who is a pioneer company in internet security also uses blue. The light blue is color of water and sky, so it gives refreshing and free feeling still retaining the reliability factor. Darker blue tends to
    give somber, heightens the security aspects of the color.</p>
<p>
    <i style="color:purple">
  Purple:</i> It mostly signifies luxury, mystery, and romance. Quiet opposite to Orange, purple give the feeling of expensiveness. The light purple brings to the mind the essence of spring and romance, especially lavender. Darker shade tends to add
    mystery and creativity, darker shade also known to turn the romantic element more sensual.
</p>
<p>
    <i style="color:#f88">Pink:</i> Innocent, young, famine ( there are very less website that uses pink as its primary color ). It the feeling of childhood and sweet memories.
</p>
<p>
    <i style="color:brown">Brown:</i> Earthy, Sturdy, Rusty (it is often paired with green ). This color is mostly associated with wooden texturing and open fields.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Black:</i> It is Powerful, sophisticated, elegant, edgy. Every web page has black as their most powerful position, that is text ( as the real communicator ). But heavy use of black may look a little scary.</p>
<p>

    <i>White:</i> It gives the feeling cleanliness, virtue and health, that is why it is related to holy spirits, god and medical staffs.
</p>
<p>
    <i style="color:#999">Gray:</i> It is the long bridge between black and white. It is Gloomy, neutral, formal.
</p>

<h3>Color Harmonies</h3>
<p>It's really great that now you can attach an emotion that defines your idea ( Project, web page, or company ), but often just one color is not enough for your web page. You need some more color to properly express your work.
</p>
<p>
    As of now you have only the base color, You need some more color to fill in, how will you pick those colors?
</p>
<p>
    You has to see color harmony. It is the set of colors that go beautifully together.
</p>
<h4>There are six types of color harmonies.</h4>

<div class="harDiv"><img src="{{baseurl}}/assets/img/blog/monochromatic.jpg" class="harmony">
    <p><i>Mono Chromatic:</i> As the name suggest, it's single color with different shades.</p>
</div>
<div class="harDiv"><img src="{{baseurl}}/assets/img/blog/analogous.jpg" class="harmony">
    <p><i>Analogous:</i> This is the set of colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel. </p>
</div>
<div class="harDiv"><img src="{{baseurl}}/assets/img/blog/triadic.jpg" class="harmony">
    <p><i>Triadic:</i> It is the set of three color that are equidistant from each other on color wheel. </p>
</div>
<div class="harDiv"><img src="{{baseurl}}/assets/img/blog/compound.jpg" class="harmony">
    <p><i>Complementary:</i> This is the set of two colors which are opposite to each other on color wheel.</p>
</div>
<div class="harDiv">
    <img src="{{baseurl}}/assets/img/blog/splitcomplimentory.jpg" class="harmony">
    <p><i>Split Complementary: </i>It is a three color set the the main color is your base color and instead of choosing opposite color as we did in complementary we choose two adjacent colors.</p>
</div>
<div class="harDiv"><img src="{{baseurl}}/assets/img/blog/tetradic.jpg" class="harmony">
    <p><i>Tetradic ( Double complementary ):</i> It's a set of 4 colors which are opposite to each other (a pair of Complementary Harmony ).</p>
</div>

<h4>But how do you check your color?</h4>
<p>There are some website that does this for you. And my personal favorite <a href='https://color.adobe.com' target="_blank">color.adobe.com</a> other than this we have <a href='http://paletton.com' target="_blank">paletton.com</a> and <a href='http://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator'
        target="_blank">www.sessions.edu/color-calculator</a>
</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>Try not to you more than three color for a single page.</p>
<p>If you have a very long page it would be a welcome edition if you can change the mood a little bit.</p>
<p>Triadic and Complementary are two widely for web Projects.</p>
<p>Never use all the colors in equal amount, use one color primarily about 70 to 80 percent and other colors to highlight the important things.</p>
<p>And at the end pick what you feel your target audience would like. </p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Color are most important part of web site designing. Every color has a emotion attached to it, find out the emotion that is right for you and your product. Know your audience, chose the proper associative colors. Use what u feel is right.</p>
<p>
    And as every thing else, this process also takes time and practice to learn.
