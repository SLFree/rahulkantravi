<h2>
    Understanding HTML5
</h2>

<article>
    <p>
        Few years back when, I when i joined IT industry i found a word that was buzzing everywhere, that is HTML5. But, there was and in-fact still is a big misconception among-st the developer about HTML5 and what it offers. We only think about
        the new tags that came with HTML5 and nothing else. But it is needless to say that is wrong. But that lets discus about history of HTML.

        <h4>History of HTML?
        </h4>

        <img src="{{baseurl}}/assets/img/blog/tim.jpg" class="harmony"> It all started in 1980's when a English born physicist working as a contractor at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Meyrin, Canton of Geneva, Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee
        proposed a prototype project called "ENQUIRE", a system to share use and document over a network or as we call it today, Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1989 Tim wrote a memo on HTML as a document that could be cross referenced with other documents, means while you are reading one research paper you can quickly refer to a section of other paper which is directly related to it.(much like Wikipedia of
        research paper).

        <h4><b>HTML 1 or just HTML.
</b>
        </h4>

        There was no official release HTML1 and the structure was also very simple. It was a free flowing structure looked like a document with very less rules and no styling. Almost all the tags were taken from SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), another
        famous markup language of that time.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h4><b>HTML 2.0
</b>
        </h4>
        Till now HTML was in a seance sub-set of SGML. But in November 1995 HTML 2.0 was published by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)it a body established for development and promotes voluntary Internet standards, in particular the standards that comprise
        the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP). Over the period of next 2yrs they added features of form-based file upload, tables, client-side image maps and internationalization. So basically HTML 2.0 was more of stander set of tags that were used by
        different browsers at that time.

    <p>
        <h4><b>HTML 3.2
</b>
        </h4>
        Next version of HTML came on January 14, 1997. HTML 3.2 was Published. the special thing about HTML 3.2 was It was the first version of HTML after Founding of w3c (World Wide Web Consortium). This again added some tags used by different browsers and standardize
        HTML markup.
    </p>

<article>
    <p>
        <h4><b>HTML 4.0
</b>
        </h4>

        W3c supersede IETF and gave a series of updates before finally coming up with the next version of HTML which was HTML 4.0 on December 18, 1997. Which was finally taken over by HTML 4.01 on December 24, 1999. The biggest feature that came with HTML 4.0
        was is use to support faulty code and deprecated elements were allowed to some extent.

        <h4><b>XHTML 1.0
</b>
        </h4>

        Now technically XHTML is not in a hierarchy HTML, but it has its history attached to it. Think of XHTML as XML serialization of DOM element. W3c started standardizing all the features of HTML used by different browsers. Even the attributes of the page.
        They wanted a strict syntax of HTML. Around that time WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) formed. It was the group which was opposing the idea of XHTML. It had the representatives of different browsers (strangely enough
        the most famous browser at that time and major player in war).
    </p>
</article>
<article>
    <p>
        <h4><b>HTML5
</b>
        </h4>

        In 2004 WHATWG drafted the idea of HTML5. In 2006 Tim Berners-Lee said though a blog post that, the attempts to move from HTML to XHTML is not going very good. In 2009 w3c officially dropped the idea of XHTML and started working with WHATWG to develop
        HTML5 and Finally lunched on October 28, 2014.<br> Now HTML5 is the only version of HTML tree that has a formal brand, including logo, a brand site, spokes persons, Marketing people and case studies.

        <h3><b>HTML5 Design Principles
</b>
        </h3>
        HTML5 was designed by W3C in alliance with WHATWG, so it ought to have some ground breaking design principles although it has many design principles, but there are some standout principles that took design community to storm. These are:- <br>
        <li><a href='#support'>Support of Existing  Content</a></li>
        <li><a href='#reinvent'>Donot Reinvent The Wheel</a></li>
        <li><a href='#evolution'>Evolution Not Revolution</a></li>
        <li><a href='#priority'>Priority of Constituencies</a></li>
    </p>
    <p>
        There are 4 different levels of Design Principles
        <li> 1. Compatibility</li>
        <li> 2. Utility</li>
        <li> 3. Interoperability </li>
        <li> 4. Universal Access </li>
    </p>
</article>

<article>
    <p>
        <h4><b>1. Compatibility</b></h4>
        This set of principles explains, how HTML5 will handle a market full of HTML 4.01 based websites and tags.
        <p>
            <b id='support'>1.1 Support of Existing Content :- </b> When HTML5 came out the market was full of website developed on HTML4, and sudden shift from HTML4 to HTML5 can crash a lot of site and inflict a great loss to the companies. So in order
            to stop the HTML5 should be able to support HTML4 too.(It was able to support almost all versions of HTML)
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1.2 Degrade Gracefully :- </b> HTML5 has given us a wide rang of new tags and even after 2 or 3 years it is still evolving to give user a better overall experience. <br> But lets be honest we can't expect our browser to support each and
            every tags starting from HTML1.<br> So instead of suddenly removing a tag or a property, HTML5 takes a liberal approach and declare it as deprecated. It means you may or may not see this tag in feature and it comes browser, if the vendor wants
            to support or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b id='reinvent'>1.3 Do Not Reinvent The Wheel:- </b> If there is already a widely used solution to a problem use the same instead of inventing new ways. Because sometimes a new solution needs new approach. If you've been working on the Web
            for some time and embracing web standards, this means that by design most of what you're accustomed to informs the development of HTML5 and you shouldn't need to relearn everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1.4 Pave The Cowpaths :- </b> When a practice is widespread, instead of forbidding it, support it even if its not the best or correct way. This makes HTML5 very forgiving language.
            <br> Like if you have &lt; hr/ &gt; or &lt;br/ &gt; tags, you can write it as &lt; hr &gt; or &lt;br &gt; too and HTML5 supports it unlike XHTML which strictly follows &lt;br/ &gt; or &lt;hr/ &gt;
        </p>

        <p id='evolution'>
            <b>1.5 Evolution Not Revolution :- </b> The whole idea behind HTML5 is to change gradually and gracefully and not forcing any one to change. Changing from HTML 4 to HTML5 overnight might create a widespread panic in the market. Moreover it
            gives the chance to add newer components over time.
        </p>
</article>
<article>
    <p>
        <h4><b>2. Utility </b></h4>
        these principles call for a design that makes sure HTML can be used effectively for its many intended purposes.
        <p>
            <b>2.1 Solve Real World Problems :- </b> If there is common in web community more often it should be taken care first. Like we needed plug-able components to play media files. But according to HTML5 you can use HTML media tags.
        </p>
        <p id='priority'>
            <b>2.2 Priority of Constituencies :- </b> If we prioritize web community according to importance user will always come first, followed by the author (web developers) followed by implementers (browser and browser development companies) after
            that specifiers (W3C who specifies the rules). This is done so that each evolution will give better look and feel for user and little bit easier for developers to develop.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>2.3 Secure by Design :- </b> HTML5 has a lot of libraries that, lets you do many things, this gives the developers freedom to do a lot of thing but they also have to take care that, this freedom should not be misused.
            <br> Ensure that features work with the security model of the web. Preferrably address security considerations directly in the specification. Communicating between documents from different sites is useful, but an unrestricted version could
            put user data at risk. Cross-document messaging is designed to allow this without violating security constraints.

        </p>



        <p>
            <b>2.4 Separation of Concerns :- </b> There are three concerns of a web view<br> (1) Structure<br> (2) Presentation<br> (3) Behavior<br> According to HTML5 the only thing HTML tags should care about is the structure, the presentation should
            be managed by CSS and we have javascript for behavior.<br> All though there are some tags that still works with the presentation like &lt; b &gt; or &lt; font &gt; because they are still widely used.
        </p>


        <p>
            <b>2.5 DOM Consistency :- </b> This design principle can be explained by the asynchronous adding of DOM element in DOM tree.<br> A HTML5 page is a DOM tree which has root tag as &lt;html&gt; tag if you want to add another DOM element in this
            tree we can do this by javascript.
            <br> Now imagine if the 2nd DOM element also starts with &lt;html&gt tag rather than start with &lt;div&gt;, &lt;section&gt; etc. In this case too the new view of the over all page should be similar to original view.
        </p>

<article>
    <p>
        <h4><b>3. Interoperability </b></h4>
        These principles exist to improve the chances of HTML implementations being truly interoperable (able to exchange and make use of information).
        <p>
            <b>3.1 Well-Defined Behavior :- </b> The rules of HTML5 or its component should be clearly defined and there should be no confusion, so that the authors can rely on the HTML for desired view on any given browser.<br> However, implementations
            should still be free to make improvements in areas such as user interface and quality of rendering.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>3.2 Avoid Needless Complexity :- </b> When there are more then one way to do something or solve a problem the simplest and easiest way should be preferred over others.<br> But this dose not mean that, the evolution of HTML5 will stop with
            that simple solution.
        </p>






        <p>
            <b>3.3 Handle Errors :- </b> HTML4 has an ability to write malformed code and have it corrected into a valid document, while rendering this is called as "tag soup". But the problem with tag soup is there are no defined rules for this. So if
            a author is writing malformed code, he has to check with different browsers.<br> In HTML5 W3C has attempted to solve this problem by giving a set of rules and it also helps in handling inaccurate syntex.
        </p>

<article>
    <p>
        <h4><b>4. Universal Access  </b></h4>
        Features should be designed for universal access. This category covers various principles related to that.
        <p>
            <b>4.1 Media Independent :- </b> There might be cases that some features of HTML5 does might not work in other medium, this can be because of feature or device compatibility of device of any other reason, that dose not mean that the feature
            is needless and we should omit it. The best example is a hyperlink. We can not use the hyperlink on a printed paper or document that does not mean that, we would omit "a" element.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>4.2 Support World Language :- </b> We all have seen website in different languages which also gives an option to translate the page in other languages. The good thing is, that can be handled by HTML5. It enables publication in all world
            languages. But this should not be taken as equalizing writing systems by prohibiting features that do not apply to all of them. Features for packing multiple translations of a document in a single file are out of scope.<br> This is because
            it supports Unicode, which allows text in most of the world's languages, including mixing of text in different languages. And Text in element content has better language support than text in attribute content; in element content ruby annotations
            can be inserted, as well as <i>dir</i>attributes and<i>bdo</i>elements in case the Unicode bidirectional algorithm is insufficient to correctly order adjacent runs of mixed direction text.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>4.3 Accessibility :- </b> Design features to be accessible to users with disabilities. Access by everyone regardless of ability is essential. This does not mean that features should be omitted entirely if not all users can make full use
            of them, but alternate mechanisms should be provided.<br> The image in an <i>img</i> may not be visible to blind users, but that is a reason to provide alternate text, not to leave out images.
            <br>Or if the <i>progress</i> element is intrinsically accessible as it has unambiguous progress bar semantics which permits mapping to accessibility APIs that can represent progress indicators.
        </p>

    <h3><b>Conclusion
</b>
    </h3>

    Because of the above design principles W3C was able to develop the HTML5, that we know and love today. And the fact that W3C is still working on it to make it a better markup language and no DOCTYPE version can be anticipated as the last version of HTML
    an it is only going to evolve rather than getting a HTML6
