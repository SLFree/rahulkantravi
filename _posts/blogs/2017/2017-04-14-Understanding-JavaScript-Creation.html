<h2>
    Understanding JavaScript Object Creation
</h2>

<article>
    <p>
AS a programer we almost every day see javascript objects in form of JSON. It is highly impossible for a programer not to have used javascript (or JSON) in one
or the other place but we never think about how many ways are there to create javascript objects, and why there are so many to create javascript objects?</p>
</article>

<h3>Ways to create javascript Objects</h3> 
<article>
    <p>
There are a lot of ways to create objects in javascript, I’ll be only talking about significant ones.</p>
<p><b>1. Using Object Literal :- </b>The best way to create a new object in javascript is by initializing it with object literals. This is the best way  because as soon as interpreter see’s  the curly bracket it gets to know that it has to create an object where as in other was the interpreter has to go on <a href="https://luv.asn.au/overheads/lex_yacc/" target="_blank">lexing</a> at least 6 more symbols.     
<br>var a={};
</p>
<p>
<b>2. Using Constructor Functions :- </b>This is a great way to create similar objects again and again.
<pre>
function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyeColor = eye;
}
var myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
var myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");
</pre>

<b>Note:</b> Although there is no restrictions on how you write a constructor function but it is always preferred to have first letter of the constructor function to be in caps and other in camel cashing.
</P>
<p>
<b>3. Using Classes :-</b> In all most all Object Oriented Programming languages we use classes to create object or to implement inheritance. As per ES5 there was no concept of classes but in ES6 javascript not only got classes but it also got concepts like “static” and “extend” same like java. The main reason that why we do this because it provides an easier understanding while inheritance, and we can create static members only through this way.
<pre>
class Cat { 
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  speak() {
    console.log(this.name + ' makes a noise.');
  }
}

class Lion extends Cat {
  speak() {
    super.speak();
    console.log(this.name + ' roars.');
  }
}
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> While using this we have to take care of only to things.
<br><b>a.</b> If we are declaring/defining a constructor in child class we have to call the constructor of super class.
<pre>
class A {
	constructor(){
	}
}
class B extends A{
	constructor(){
	super();
	}
} //even if there are no implementation in super class constructor.
</pre>
<b>b.</b> The “extends” keyword works only with classes or constructor functions and not with objects.
</p>
<p><b>4. Using Object.create() :- </b>Create method in Object help in creating a new object with pass object as prototype of new object. This is really helpful as it provide inheritance on object level and in this way we don’t need any constructor for in heritance.
<pre>
// Animal properties and method encapsulation
var Animal = {
  type: 'Invertebrates', // Default value of properties
  displayType: function() {  // Method which will display type of Animal
    console.log(this.type);
  }
};

// Create new animal type called animal1 
var animal1 = Object.create(Animal);
animal1.displayType(); // Output:Invertebrates

// Create new animal type called Fishes
var fish = Object.create(Animal);
fish.type = 'Fishes';
fish.displayType(); // Output:Fishes
</pre>
</p>
<p><b>5. Using new Object() :- </b>This is the last way I want talk about. new with a constructor of Object works exactly similar to how tow curly brackets ({}) works. But when you pass something in the constructor it behaves very differently. It actually creates the wrapper class for the type of parameter.
<pre>
var firstName = new Object("John");
//same as var firstName2 = new Object("John");

var num = new Object (10);
// same as var = new Number(10);
</pre>
This way does not look very useful but0 imagine a situation when you don’t know what kind of response might come and based on the type of response you have to do something. You can always write a set of if conditions for checking, one for number, one for string, one for Boolean and so on, or you can use new Object(val), the choice is yours.

<h3>How Javascript objects are destroyed
</h3>
<article>
    <p>
 JavaScript objects and variables are destroyed when they become inaccessible, meaning when there is no possible reference to them in the current execution context. The JavaScript runtime has to continuously monitor for this kind of elements. So unless we use the delete keyword to remove something, then its destruction is sort of under the hood. Some browsers are bad at detecting references left in closure scope and that is why we often see objects being set to null at the end of functions to make sure that memory is freed.

    <p>
JavaScript is a pretty powerful Object Oriented Programming Language. And the the first step in understanding object oriented programming language is to understange it's object.
